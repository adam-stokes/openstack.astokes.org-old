Developer Guide
===============

The document walks you through installing the necessary packages and environment preparations in order to build the cloud installer.

There is also auto-generated API Documentation \<modules\> available.

Base system
-----------

Development and testing is done on Ubuntu and using a release of **Trusty** or later.

Building cloud installer
------------------------

> **note**
>
> Although not required, **Sbuild** is the preferred way for building the package set. Please refer to this [wiki page](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SimpleSbuild) on setting up sbuild.
>
> Just like the base system the sbuild chroots need to be Trusty or later, but the architecture of the chroots does not matter.

Once **sbuild** is configured, checkout the source code of the installer:

``` {.sourceCode .}
$ git clone https://github.com/Ubuntu-Solutions-Engineering/openstack-installer.git ~/openstack-installer
$ cd ~/openstack-installer
$ make git-sync-requirements
```

Use the target 'install-dependencies' to install a custom binary package for the build dependencies:

``` {.sourceCode .}
$ make install-dependencies
```

From here you can build the entire package set by running:

``` {.sourceCode .}
$ make sbuild
# or, if you prefer not to use sbuild:
$ make deb
# or a source only package
$ make deb-src
```

Once finished your packages will be stored in the top level directory where your OpenStack project is kept.

``` {.sourceCode .}
$ ls ../*.deb
```

Running the OpenStack installer
-------------------------------

Running the installer for testing currently requires installing the packages. (Unit tests can be run without installing the packages, provided the install-dependencies make target has been run.)

> **warning**
>
> Running the installer as below will install MAAS on your development system. This will create a 'maas' user and add a database to your local postgres instance. It will also configure bind9 DNS and a DHCP server for use with MAAS, although MAAS should not activate those by default. If any of this is not desirable, you will need to find a different machine to develop on.

After building the packages using either 'make deb' or 'make sbuild', you can install and run with the 'run' target:

``` {.sourceCode .}
$ sudo make run type=single
# or
$ sudo make run type=multi
```

You can also set the MAAS\_HTTP\_PROXY env var for the openstack-install command like this:

``` {.sourceCode .}
$ sudo make run type=single proxy=http://myproxy/
```

If you are running the landscape installer, you will want to use the 'landscape' target:

``` {.sourceCode .}
$ sudo make landscape proxy=http://myproxy/
```

Running the OpenStack status screen
-----------------------------------

If you have run the installer and are working on changes to the status screen (in cloudinstall/), you can re-run the status screen with the correct python path using this target:

``` {.sourceCode .}
$ make status
```

If you are testing the status screen's code for deploying charms, you may need to first start your juju environment over from scratch:

``` {.sourceCode .}
$ juju destroy-environment local
$ juju bootstrap
$ make status
```

Changing the log level
----------------------

The openstack-status program logs to \~/.cloud-install/commands.log. The default log level for that log is "DEBUG". Most of the program logs at the DEBUG level, which is the most verbose that is currently defined. If you want a different log level, you can set the UCI\_LOGLEVEL environment variable. Your choices are "DEBUG", "INFO", "WARNING", "ERROR", and "CRITICAL".

``` {.sourceCode .}
$ UCI_LOGLEVEL=ERROR openstack-status
```

Building documentation
----------------------

Documentation will be built in **docs/\_build/html**, and requires **Sphinx** to build.

``` {.sourceCode .}
$ cd docs && make html
```

Running Tests
-------------

A unit test suite is in tests/ and is run using [Nose](https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) and [tox](https://testrun.org/tox/latest/). Tox will cover both pep8 and flakes automatically and unit tests do not require a live Juju or MAAS connection.

Run it as follows:

``` {.sourceCode .}
$ make test
```
